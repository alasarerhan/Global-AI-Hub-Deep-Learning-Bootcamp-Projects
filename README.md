Welcome to my Deep Learning project repository. This repository contains three distinct projects demonstrating the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). These projects were developed as part of the Akbank Deep Learning Project Camp, organized by Global AI Hub and 10million.AI in collaboration with Akbank and SabancÄ± Holding.

# Projects Overview
## 1. Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Dataset: Datefruit Dataset

In this project, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was built to classify images from the Datefruit dataset. The project focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts of ANN, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## 2. Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Dataset: CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The CNN is designed to effectively extract features from images and improve classification accuracy.

## 3. Building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Dataset: IMDB Reviews Dataset

In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was implemented to analyze sentiment from movie reviews using the IMDB dataset. The project emphasizes the application of RNNs for sequence data and natural language processing tasks.
